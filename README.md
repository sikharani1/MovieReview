------OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS ---------
The application, in this release, contains the Naive Bayes Classifier and a specific amount of 
train and test data. The program will be trained based on the training data and will classify 
the test data based on a sentiment range of 0 to 4. Once the first page comes up, you can provide a title of the movie,
such as Blood Work, and the program gives the percentage distribution of peopleâ€™s sentiment for each movie. 


The accompanying training folders and test folders are divided based on the sentiments. The training phrases that 
belong to the sentiment 0 are in the train/0.txt file and so on. The test phrases that belong to the sentiment 0 
are in the test/0.txt file and so on.
